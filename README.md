- Explantion : This is my Portfolio Website that I built by putting all websites together in it,
by this, I came to learn more about Animation libraries not to mention Styled-components.

- Hard Part and Solution :
1. Most Hart Part overall is implementing scroll-animation-effect in Responsive site with GSAP, Whenever window size is adjusted, the scroloo value also changed.. so I had to do all the math to find proper value with legwork.(ContactMe, MoonStarScroll, MyPath, Skills, Videos, Etc..) (time-consuming-process)
2. Of course, I had some part that I refered to from some other's portfolios, but I wantted to create most of it with my ideas. so, It was full of Pain of Creative mind... (time-consuming-process2)
3. While Buliding Email part and giving it scroll-animation, sometimes click didn't work on text-input but I found It was because I made SVG-Image to cover all background with the high value of Z-index initially, so It took time to find out the reason. but this error helpped me to have upgraded solving problem skill
